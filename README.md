* I recorded a video showcasing the code, which might make the evaluation easier. You can access the video via this link: Watch Video on Google Drive
* To simplify execution outside of the Databricks environment, I decided to use Google Colab with Google Drive integration to run Spark, as the platform for execution wasnâ€™t specified. I chose this option for practicality.

* The folder structure is visualized below:
